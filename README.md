# Fruit Ripeness Classification Project

This project aims to classify the ripeness of fruits using the YOLO v11 model. The model is designed to predict whether a fruit is fresh or rotten, providing a practical solution for assessing fruit quality in markets, agriculture, and the food industry.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gulcihanglmz/pattern-recognition-final-project

## Usage
To start the project, open and run fruit_ripeness_classification_model_test.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains the code necessary for testing and evaluating the model.

Open fruit_ripeness_classification_model_test.ipynb.
Run the cells in order to train or test the model and observe the results.

## File Descriptions
fruit_ripeness_classification_model_test.ipynb: The main notebook file for the project, used for training, testing, and evaluating the model.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.

## Method
This project uses the YOLO v11 algorithm to classify fruit ripeness. The model analyzes images to predict if a fruit is fresh or rotten. YOLO v11 was chosen for its high accuracy and speed in object detection tasks.

## Steps:
Prepare and label the image data.
Train the YOLO v11 model on the data.
Test and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Future Improvements
This project can be further developed with the following improvements:

Use a larger dataset to increase model accuracy.
Expand classification capabilities by including additional ripeness levels.
Implement real-time classification capabilities.
