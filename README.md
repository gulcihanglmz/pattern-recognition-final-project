# Fruit Ripeness Classification Project

This project aims to classify the ripeness of fruits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is designed to predict whether a fruit is fresh or rotten, providing a practical solution for assessing fruit quality in markets, agriculture, and the food industry.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gulcihanglmz/pattern-recognition-final-project

## File Descriptions
- `CNN-model-predict-interface/main.py`: The main notebook file for the project, used for training, testing, and evaluating the model.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.

## Method
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fruit ripeness. The model analyzes images to predict if a fruit is fresh or rotten. CNNs were chosen for their effectiveness in image classification tasks.

## Steps:
1. Prepare and label the image data.
2. Train the CNN model on the data.
3. Test and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Future Improvements
This project can be further developed with the following improvements:

- Use a larger dataset to increase model accuracy.
- Expand classification capabilities by including additional ripeness levels.
- Implement real-time classification capabilities.
